      <h2>Thanks for stopping by 🫡 let me show you around</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Emerson, an Electronics Engineer who loves turning vague problems into clear,
        practical solutions. When something isn’t working as it should, I don’t just work
        around it — I redesign the system behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I realised my technical skills were growing faster than my ability to
        communicate them, so I joined Toastmasters and started working deliberately on my
        communication and leadership. The same mindset guides how I learn, work, and improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you scroll through this page, you’ll find what I’m currently working on, projects
        I’m building or experimenting with, notes where I think out loud, and certifications
        that support the work I do.
