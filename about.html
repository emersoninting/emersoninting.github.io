                    <p>I graduated from Lyceum of the Philippines University â€“ Cavite Campus with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering, passed the Electronics and Communications Engineering and Electronics Technicians board exam on April 2023.</p>
                    <p>My hobby is reading self-help book, lifting, playing games, and creating contents. During my academic journey, I actively participated in various activity like volunteering work and joining quiz shows, it allowed me to broaden my point of view that there is so much more than school and there is much more to learn.</p>
                    <p>Today, I specialize in network security and infrastructure, helping companies protect and grow their systems.</p>
